Dynamic optimization techniques like model predictive control (MPC) and moving horizon estimation (MHE) are crucial in robot control but heavily depend on finely tuned hyperparameters, traditionally set through substantial human effort and expert knowledge, thus limiting system autonomy. This thesis leverages recent trends in bilevel optimization to automate this process, employing a hierarchical framework
where machine learning techniques optimize hyperparameters based on the results of lower-level dynamic optimization. It explores new methods that integrate the dynamic optimization into neural networks via the bilevel optimization, significantly enhancing the training process.
